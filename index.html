    <p> On the Brink: </p>
    </div>
  <h1> Settling the War in Ukraine </h1> 
  <div class="introinfo">
    <p> After several months of diplomatic gridlock between Russia, Ukraine, and NATO states, the region has unfortunately been plunged into conflict.As the Russian military closes in on Kyiv, hundreds to thousands of soldiers have already perished in the fighting, while thousands to tens of thousands more civilians have also died or have lost their homes and family members. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already indirectly threatened nuclear retaliation if NATO intervenes, while numerous Western European nations and the United States are on the precipice of war. </p>
    <p> You are an upper level advisor to the Secretary of Defense who is highly educated and trusted by the department. You have been granted incredible influence in this situation, and much wield your power carefully in order to prevent an invaion of Ukraine to the best of your ability. Although you have not been granted unlimited power, your position as a trusted foreign service officer and statesman means that your decisions will, effectively, be pursued by these departments. You have been entrusted to pursue a policy of smart-power,<em> Good luck. </em> </p>

     <a id="CrisisSimulation"> </a>
     <h2> Get Started </h2> 
  <p> You will be given a set of decisions where your choice can make or break avoiding a Ukrainian invasion. You will be taken to the set outcome of each choice after you caluculate your decison. You will either be able to make another decision if you chose the correct path, and if not, Ukraine gets invaded and you have failed your mission. You have failed to sucessfully execute a plan that prevents a Ukrainian invasion and possibly an international security crisis. </p> 
  </div>
<!--Section 1-->
  <div class="decision1">
  <h3> Getting Your Foot in the Door </h3> 
  <p> What is your first decision as chairperson of the Ukrainian Joint-Advisory Committee? </p> 
    <p> Advise that the DoD commence a military invasion of Russia, deploying ground troops into Ukraine and targeting key strategic military sites on Russian soil.
 </p> 
    <a href="#choice1">Military Invasion</a>
  <p> Draw a red-line past the Donbas region, delineating this area as a “war zone” independent of the rest of Ukraine for fighting to be contained. </p> 
    <a href="#choice2">Draw a Red-Line</a>
      <p> Contact NATO allies and Ukraine to discuss an effective course of action that brings heads of state and representatives to the table. </p> 
    <a href="#choice3">Contact NATO</a>
  </div>
  <div class="decision1result">
  <a id="choice1"> </a>
    <p> Military Invasion - FAILURE </p>
    <p> This action sparks all-out war, causing Russian forces in Ukraine to double their efforts and effectively plunging the world into World War III. Diplomacy is now virtually impossible as Russia feels backed into a corner and all future negotiations will rely on Putin’s willingness to be embarrassed by defeat.
 </p>
  </div>
  <div class="decision2result">
  <p> Draw a Red-Line - FAILURE </p> 
    <a id="choice2"> </a>
    <p> Drawing this line unilaterally angers your allies, who feel betrayed and begin to pull out of the unity which has been built over the last few weeks. Fighting does not remain isolated to the Donbas region and the Russian military now accelerates its invasion to beat out future attempts to influence the situation and win the war fast. The US is now effectively left on its own to either defend Ukraine or abandon it to its fate. </p>
</div> 
  <div class="decision3result">
  <p> Contact NATO - SUCCESS </p> 
    <a id="choice3"> </a>
    <p> The United States’ NATO allies, along with representatives from Ukraine, agree to a summit in Berlin in which participants discuss reactions, strategy, and investments in the crisis. All members present are looking for a diplomatic solution, although some (specifically Eastern European allies like Poland and Romania) are willing to interfere militarily, believing that the alternative is eventual subjugation by the Russians. Emboldened by this multilateral approach, NATO and Ukraine are now better prepared for future action while non-NATO European states look to the organization for hope that the crisis may be resolved. </p>
</div>
<!--Section 2--> 
  <div class="decision1">
  <h3> Offending the Russians </h3> 
  <p> While your meeting between the NATO states and Ukraine managed to coordinate a more comprehensive response, Russian officials–along with their Belorussian allies—are now critiquing the US, claiming that it is planning to invade the Russian Federation. How do you respond? </p> 
    <p> Promise swift action against the Russian state and its military and advise our military to invade Russian targets preliminarily. </p> 
    <a href="#section2choice1">Advise a Preliminary Invasion</a>
  <p> Draw a human-rights red-line, vowing military intervention if Russia introduces biological or chemical weapons or deploys nuclear armaments into Belarus. </p> 
    <a href="#section2choice2">Draw a Red-Line</a>
    <p> Bide time until Russia presents an opportunity for action. </p> 
    <a href="#section2choice3">Bide Time</a>
  </div>
  <div class="decision1result">
  <a id="section2choice1"> </a>
    <p> Advise a Preliminary Invasion - FAILURE </p>
    <p> While some NATO states are willing to join the United States in war against the Russian Federation, most refuse to provide supplies or troops. Although the US and its allies are militarily capable against Russian armed forces, the crisis evolves into continent-wide warfare as World War III erupts. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="decision2result">
  <p> Draw a Red-Line - SUCCESS </p> 
    <a id="section2choice2"> </a>
    <p> Upon advisement, President Joseph Biden announces during a press-conference that the US will intervene if biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons are deployed against Ukrainian forces or citizens, while simultaneously warning Ukraine to not use any kind of WMD as well. Although Russia does not publicly respond to these threats, Vladimir Putin responds in a direct-line to Biden that he will not use biological or chemical weapons, saying nothing of nuclear arms. </p>
</div> 
  <div class="decision3result">
  <p> Bide Time - FAILURE </p> 
    <a id="section2choice3"> </a>
    <p> In doing nothing, the Russian military continues to roll over Ukrainian forces, eventually forcing the Zelenskyy government into peace talks and forcing the surrender of eastern Ukrainian territory. </p>
  </div>
<!--Section 3 -->
  <div class="decision1">
  <h3> Crisis at Kherson </h3> 
  <p> Shortly after this announcement, a protest breaks out in the city of Kherson, where dozens of civilians begin opposing Russian occupation. Although initially mellow, protestors soon begin throwing rocks and broken bottles at occupying troops, eventually leading one soldier to fire upon the group. The incident kills three and wounds four others. How do you respond? </p> 
    <p> Encourage Ukrainian citizens to continue protesting and order a strike back against Russian military forces. </p> 
    <a href="#section3choice1">Encourage the Protests</a>
  <p> Attempt to calm Ukraine on the basis that accidents happen during wartime in the hope of preventing Ukrainian retaliation. </p> 
    <a href="#section3choice2">Try to Calm Down the Situation</a>
    <p> Demand that Russia apologize for the attack against civilians, compensate the families of the fallen and injured, and attempt to defuse Ukraine. </p> 
    <a href="#section3choice3"> Demand an Apology</a>
  </div>
  <div class="decision1result">
  <a id="section3choice1"> </a>
    <p> Encourage the Protests - FAILURE </p>
    <p> Due to the nature of continued protests and the violent response to the incident, the crisis begins to enlarge in size and scope. Although the US’ NATO allies are encouraged by the dilemma to also retaliate against the Russian Federation, the combined assault pushes Russia into a corner and risks sparking nuclear war. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="decision2result">
  <p> Try to Calm Down the Situation - FAILURE </p> 
    <a id="section3choice2"> </a>
    <p>  In attempting only to defuse the situation on Ukraine’s half, Zelenskyy argues that it is not enough that the realities of war be accepted as inevitable. Feeling that his forces are doing too little to defend, Ukraine begins wholesale allowing for total war strategies, gravely impacting the conditions of Ukrainian and Russian POWs. </p>
</div> 
    <div class="decision3result">
  <p> Demand an Apology - SUCCESS </p> 
    <a id="section3choice3"> </a>
    <p> Vladimir Putin, in a rare instance of open-channel communication, formally apologizes for the actions of the soldier at Kherson. While he refuses to compensate more than the cost of the injured civilians’ medical care, the instance of humanity in time of war calms Ukrainian officials and settles the dispute. </p>
    </div>
<!--Section 4 -->
  <div class="decision1">
  <h3> Water for the Masses </h3> 
  <p> Since the occupation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine has routinely cut-off fresh water access to residential and commercial areas in Sevastopol and other Crimean settlements. In any given day, 85% of Crimea will only have access to potable water for 3-5 hours. One member of the committee has suggested that we advise Ukraine return water access to Crimea, while another argues that doing so will only concede power incrementally to Russia and make Ukraine appear weak. How do you respond? </p> 
    <p> Advise that the Ukrainian government provides water access to Crimean citizens unconditionally out of an act of good-will. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice1"> Provide Water </a>
  <p> Refuse the suggestion and allow Ukraine to continue cutting off water to the population in Crimea. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice2"> Cut Off Water to Crimea </a>
    <p> Advise that the Ukrainian government provides water access to Crimean citizens under the condition that better treatment be allotted to Ukrainian citizens. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice3"> Provide Water Under Circumstances </a>
  </div>
  <div class="decision1result">
  <a id="section4choice1"> </a>
    <p> Provide Water - FAILURE </p>
    <p> US representatives plead with Zelenskyy to reopen water access to the population living in Crimea, but his government refuses. His cabinet argues near-unanimously that doing so would only be giving supplies to the enemy, and many Russian troops are currently stationed in Crimea. Ukraine continues to restrict water access to Crimea. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="decision2result">
  <p> Cut Off Water to Crimea - FAILURE </p> 
    <a id="section4choice2"> </a>
    <p> Ukraine continues to prevent water access to Crimea on the grounds that the occupied area is Russian territory and, as such, does not deserve Ukrainian resources. While many soldiers are stationed at Sevastopol, the civilians living there continue to suffer from inaccessibility to potable water, with Russia unable to compensate due to the war effort and attention toward Ukraine. </p>
      </div>
     <div class="decision3result">
  <p> Provide Water Under Circumstances - SUCCESS </p> 
    <a id="section4choice3"> </a>
    <p> Ukraine, understanding that there is an opportunity for a more humanitarian conflict, begins talks with Russian officials to resume fresh water access to Crimea on the condition that Russian officials promise greater care toward Ukrainian POWs and those living in occupied areas. Russian officials agree, and a basis for communication between Russia and Ukraine is successfully established. </p>
    </div>
<!--Section 5 -->
 <div class="decision1">
  <h3> Bargaining for Peace </h3> 
  <p> After a month of fighting, the war has come to a deadlock. Kyiv has not been occupied and the Ukrainian government manages to continue administering its country, but Russian occupation continues and has not reached out for a settlement. After some negotiation, both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree to a congress in London to attempt to settle the crisis. How do you respond? </p> 
    <p> Advise that US representatives demand that Russian military forces leave Ukraine at once and surrender. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice1"> Advise Military Forces Leave </a>
  <p> Advise that US representatives attempt to convince Ukraine to sacrifice the territory Russia is seeking in exchange for peace. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice2"> Convince Ukraine to Scrifice Territory </a>
    <p> Advise that US representatives demand that Russia leave entirely while simultaneously attempting to negotiate concessions to the Russian government. </p> 
    <a href="#section4choice3"> Advise Russia Leaves </a>
  </div>
  <div class="decision1result">
  <a id="section4choice1"> </a>
    <p> Advise Military Forces Leave - FAILURE </p>
    <p> When US representatives attempt to come across with a strong-arm stance, Vladimir Putin is silent and gathers his party, leaving the caucus. War continues to rage in Ukraine as the government continues to be battered and world seems ever closer to World War III. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="decision2result">
  <p> Convince Ukraine to Scrifice Territory - FAILURE </p> 
    <a id="section4choice2"> </a>
    <p> When US representatives attempt to convince Zelenskyy’s delegation to concede the land and resources Russia is looking for, he becomes enraged and curses the American representatives for betraying Ukraine. He vows to ride out the war and leaves, with the war continuing and the world inching ever closer to World War III. </p>
      </div>
     <div class="decision3result">
  <p> Advise Russia Leaves - SUCCESS </p> 
    <a id="section4choice3"> </a>
    <p> When US representatives attempt to propose a middle-ground solution, both delegations are initially quiet and uncertain. Luckily, a member of the Russian delegation asks the representatives to continue, giving them the opportunity to explain that Ukraine will cede Donbas as an independent set of states and allow for a transparent referendum to permanently leave or join the Russian Federation. In addition, a moratorium is placed on Ukraine in regard to joining NATO, although this does not prohibit the state from joining 10 years down the line. After a week of back-and-forth, these terms are ultimately settled upon and Russian forces begin to leave Ukraine.  <em> Crisis has been averted! </em> </p>
